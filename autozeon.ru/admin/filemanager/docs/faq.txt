Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for PHPFM:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) If I try to upload files over 2 MB all uploads fail. What can I do?
A) By default the maximum upload size it set to 2 MB in php.ini. Find the
   following line ...
   upload_max_filesize = 2M
   ... and increase the size to something more appropriate.

Q) If I upload files larger than 8 MB the script the script returns an error
   similar to "Maximum post size reached - see docs/faq.txt for more information."
   What is wrong?
A) Find the line ...
   post_max_size = 8M
   ... in php.ini and replace 8 with the number og MB you want to be able to
   upload.

Q) The script returns the an error similar to "Fatal error: Maximum execution
   time of XX seconds exceeded in /path/to/phpfm/index.php on line X" when I
   upload large files. What can I do?
A) You will have to edit the following line in php.ini ...
   max_execution_time = 30
   ... and increase the number of seconds to whatever you need.

Q) PHPFM returns a lot of errors similar to "Notice: Undefined variable:
   _SERVER in /path/to/phpfm/index.php on line X". What is wrong?
A) PHPFM requires PHP 4.1.0 or higher since the $_SERVER, $_GET, $_POST
   and $_COOKIE superglobals were introduced in 4.1.0.

Q) I run PHPFM from a Linux/UNIX server and everything fails. What is wrong?
A) PHP normally runs as user "nobody", which means that PHP has no permission
   to alter anything unless you set public read/write access on the files and
   folders you want PHPFM to be able to alter. This is not very smart, and I
   am trying to find some kind of work-around for this.

Q) The login system does not work. I can't log in. What is the problem?
A) This is a know bug to me, however, I have not been able to actually test
   on a system where the login system does not work. So if the login system
   does not work at your webserver, please let me know if you will allow me
   to test on your system. Thanks a lot!
