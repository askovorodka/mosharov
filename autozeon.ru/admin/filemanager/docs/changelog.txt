PHPFM version 0.2.0:
 Note: The whole script has been rewritten from scratch, which virtually means
 that everything has changed. I'll try to point out the most important changes
 here:

 - the script's design has been greatly improved (in my opinion).
 - the script does not require globals to be registered any longer, nor does it
   produce errors when error reporting is set to E_ALL. This means that PHPFM will
   run perfectly on PHP 4.2.X and up now!
 - the script is now split up in several files to make editing easier for myself
   and others. Note: the variables used to include the new files are checked with
   is_file() and checked for '../' and '..\', so the script is NOT vulnerable
   in any way to a possible malicious user.
 - language support is now included. English is the only language avalible right
   now though.
 - the script now uses valid HTML (4.01 transitional) and CSS. Check www.w3c.org
   for more information.
 - a "file library" is now included with PHPFM, which means that the download and
   temporary directories are no longer needed.
 - directories for temporary (images) and downloaded files are no longer needed,
   as files are downloaded directly using a "download" library now.
 - output from rename, delete, download etc. is now printed at the same page as
   the filebrowser, so you don't have to click "back" any more.
 - directories are now deleted recursively which means that they do not need to
   be empty to delete them.
 - you can now see permissions on each file.
 - it is now possible to sort file data by filename, filesize, permissions and
   last modification time both ascending and descending.
 - you will now have to click on the respective icon instead of on the filename
   to edit or view a file.
 - all icons are now transparent and defined with width and height for faster
   loading times.
 - a message saying how many seconds the page took to produce is now displayed at
   the bottom of every page. Pretty useless, but fun :)
