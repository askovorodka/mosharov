Todo list for PHPFM:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- find work-around for permissions on GNU/Linux & UNIX systems.
- make a login system where each user has his/hers own home directory and permissions.
- some kind of logging system.
- make an install script which makes it easier to install PHPFM.
- make hidden files unaccessible by the script (again).
- index with thumbnails of all images in the current directory (uncertain).
- make it possible to change permissions (chmod) on files and directories.
- make it so you can compress a directory and download it.
- do so you can see the full size of a directory (including sub-directories) and how
  many files that are in the directory.
- templates for new (created) files. For instance PHP, HTML etc.
- unix style permissions (e.g. -rw-rw-rw-)
- create "Content-type" headers in libfile.php for all the MIME types.
- too long directory- and filenames are shortened so they do not ruin the design.
- templates for PHPFM. Change the look of PHPFM easily! (not provisional)
- more languages.
- add some nifty DHTML?
- add some kind of check for magic_quotes_gpc.
- add the drive browser again?
- PDF viewer and text/PHP viewer with highlighting.
